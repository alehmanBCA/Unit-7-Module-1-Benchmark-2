    "# Benchmark - Class Dog Boarder\n",
    "Your job is to create a *DogBoarder* class that manages the boarding process for dogs at a kennel. It allows for tracking the number of occupied slots, boarding dogs, and calculating the cost of boarding based on a daily rate. This class ensures that the number of dogs does not exceed the available slots and provides functionality to calculate the total cost when a dog is picked up. Also, you have provided test cases to help check your methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## You should have the following methods:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- all_dogs() - Returns the collection of all dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- is_full() - Check if the boarding facility is full.\n",
    "- Returns (bool): True if the boarding facility is full, False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- slots_occupied() - Get the number of currently occupied slots.\n",
    "- Returns (int): The number of slots currently occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- board(dog, breed, name) - Board a dog if there is an available slot. Store the dog as a dictionary (e.g., {\"dog\": name, \"breed\": breed, \"name\": owner}) into the list of all dogs.\n",
    "- dog (str): Identifier for the dog (e.g., name or ID).\n",
    "- breed (str): Breed of the dog.\n",
    "- name (str): Name of the owner.\n",
    "- Returns (str): A message if they boarded the dog or there are no available slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "pick_up(dog, breed, name, days) - Pick up a dog and calculate the total cost based on the number of days stayed.\n",
    "- dog (str): Identifier for the dog (e.g., name or ID).\n",
    "- breed (str): Breed of the dog.\n",
    "- name (str): Name of the dog.\n",
    "- days (int): Number of days the dog has been boarded.\n",
    "- Returns (str or int): The total cost of boarding the dog for the specified number of days if they are already boarded. Otherwise, it will return an error message."
